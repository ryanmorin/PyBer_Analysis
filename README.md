# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The analysis looks at the ride sharing data for PyBer grouped by Pyber's three locations: Urban, Rural and Suburban. The report will use the data gleaned from the analysis to make a series of recommendations to PyBer's CEO; V. Isualize to addess the differences between the three locations.

## Results
60% of PyBer's fare revenue comes from Urban locations while 30% comes from Urban locations. Urban locations also have the greatest concentration of PyBer drivers, this is 7x's the number of drivers in Suburban locations and 120x's the number in rural locations. The average fare per ride in Urban areas is the lowest among the three locations at $24.50.  Rural locations have the highest average fare per ride at $34.60.  The average fare per ride are high compared to the average fare per driver. Rural drivers have the highest average fare at $8 whereas Urban drivers average $0.70.

## Summary
I'm assuming that the drivers are independent contractors and therefore PyBer doesn't pay drivers unless they generate revenue. If you compare the average fare per ride to the average fare per driver, PyBer has a large number of drivers who aren't generating any revenue. PyBer may want to experiment with lowering its prices as a way to increase ridership. Lower prices might attract new users and offset the revenue lost from lower prices. There's ample drivers to pick up the additional customers so customer service wouldn't suffer.

PyBer could consider charging all of it's drivers a small administration fee.  Therefore regardless of the amount of revenue that a driver generates, PyBer gets compensated.

Finally PyBer could charge a different rate based on the time of day that the customer used its service. PyBer is able to take advantage of demand for its service and generates more revenue.
